# Create React Workshop

This is the code used in the workshop: Practical React with Typescript.

The `master` branch contains the starter code you can clone to begin working with the respository. You can find the code we built together throughout the course in a separate `course/*` sub branch named the date of the first course day.

## Getting started

Before you begin there are a few prerequisites you should have installed and set up:

- Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) (preferrably the latest LTS version)
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com) for your OS
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VSCode), you can use any IDE you prefer, but this project comes with settings specifically for Visual Studio Code.
- Create a Github account if you do not already have one.

After installing the necessary prerequisites you can clone the code to your machine using a git terminal command, or if you prefer a UI you can use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).

Once you have the code on your machine you need to install all dependencies. Do this by running the command `npm i` from a terminal in the root folder of the project. After it completes you can start VSCode in the folder by running the command `code .`

At startup VSCode might ask you to install recommended extensions. Do this to get a better IDE experience for this project.

To start the development environment you can either run the `npm` command `start`: `npm start` or run the task `start` using the task palette `Ctrl+P -> "task start"`. After a few seconds your browser should open to `http://localhost:3000` and show the text "Hello World".
